Softek Illuminate HIPAA/HITECH Policy
=====================================

Outline
--------

This is some text that should demonstrate the simpleness of the idea and show that the mispelings and other revisions can be tracked easilly, but the formatting _isn't_ lost.

I think we can agree that collaboration is an important part of these policies.  Collaboration helps buy-in.  Github is great at facilitating collaboration, especially while a document is in the initial stages.  RFCs are, well, requests for comments, and I draw some inspiration from that name.
